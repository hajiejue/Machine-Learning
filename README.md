Disadvantages of K-Means
  1 The number of clusters has to be set in the beginning
  2 The results depend on the inital cluster centers
  3 It's sensitive to outliers
  4 It's not suitable for finding non-convex clusters
  5 It's not guaranteed to find a global optimum, so it can get stuck in a local minimum
